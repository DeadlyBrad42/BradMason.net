              <h4>A course management system for instructors and students</h4>
              <time datetime="4-2012">April 2012</time>
              <p>Student's Friend is a course management system built by myself and teammates for our Senior Project class at PSU. It offered students a way to manage their coursework, schedule, and get help with assignments. It featured logging in via the Facebook API, some light social integration, and varying levels of access for instructors and students.</p>
              <p>Some of the other features included in the system were a forum for interacting with the instructor and classmates, a flashcard system for study assitance, a seperate calendar for each course, and support for uploading files to share with the class. Instructors have full control of all their classes, and students were able to create flashcards to share with the class, and upload their notes and other files to share with the class.</p>
              <p>The project was all-inclusive from designing the system, implementing it, and documenting all of the features. The system itself was written in PHP, and used JavaScript and jQuery for AJAX and stylized effects. The system ran on an Apache webserver and utilized a MySQL database.</p>

              <p>Poof is a command line tool for saving and retrieving <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a> links. It was written in C# and designed to use an Access database.</p>

              <h4>An Android app that displays large text on screen.</h4>
              <time datetime="">datetime</time>
              <p>Billboard is an Android app I worked on in 2011 to familiarize myself with the Android SDK. It's primary function is to display large text on the screen, which is actually more useful than it sounds.</p>
              <p>Although the app itself is pretty simple I was able to learn a lot about how Android handles views and dialogs, interfaces with a SQLite database, and the basics of drawing to a screen using canvas. The app is open source, and will be available on Google Play as soon as I get the time to hunt down the remaining bugs.</p>

              <h4>A prototype raytracing program written in C++.</h4>
              <time datetime="">datetime</time>
              <p>Pixel Pipeline was a 3D scene renderer I built in C++ back in 2009. It was able to render scenes made of cubes represented by a three dimensional array. I never quite got the rendering code perfect, but making bitmap images in code always felt pretty awesome.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the source code has been lost to time (and hard drive crashes). But, the project was a good learning experience for me, and I have a lot of ideas for building version 2.</p>
