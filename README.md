## Cool Features
* **Views and view components (viewmodels)** are written in [Vue](http://http://vuejs.org). Mainly because I wanted to try a new MVVM framework that was small, fast, and easy to use. I was also itching to tread away from the libraries that I already knew.
* I opted to write my own **router**. A quick glance around the 'net only revealed that many routing libraries were complete overkill for this small project, and the few simple routing libraries I did find only served to inspire me to give it a try on my own.
* **Styles** are written in LESS for organization, modularity, and maintainability. I'm using [Atom](https://atom.io/) and the [less-autocompile library](https://atom.io/packages/less-autocompile) to compile to CSS on-the-fly, but you could also use the vanilla LESS compiler.
* All **animation** is done through CSS (well, technically LESS). I chose this method primarily because I believe in separating presentation code from utility code.
* The page was **tested** in every browser I could get my hands on, which includes *Chrome*, *Firefox*, *Safari*, and *Internet Explorer* on *OS X*, *Windows*, *Android*, and *iOS*.
* There is a small easter egg inspired by the [world's most famous cheat code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code).
